Welcome to SPH-EXA
==================

The `SPH-EXA project <https://hpc.dmi.unibas.ch/HPC/SPH-EXA.html>`_ has the following main objectives:

- Design parallelization methods targeted for SPH codes, that can be ported to other codes in the scientific community. 

- Enable the scalability and dynamic load balancing of the SPH hydrodynamics technique within single compute nodes and across massive numbers of nodes.

- Design fault-tolerance mechanisms to sustain the scalable execution of massively parallel SPH codes.

- Build a repository of experiments to enable verification, reproducibility, and portability of the execution and simulation results of SPH-EXA codes.
