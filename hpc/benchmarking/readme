# memory:
if the user only needs a single core but more than 2000mb of memory they need
to specify how much memory they want slurm to allocate in their submission.

scontrol show config | grep -i mem
DefMemPerCPU = 2000
MaxMemPerNode = UNLIMITED
SelectTypeParameters = CR_CPU_MEMORY,CR_LLN

Could you try to define the memory per node in the batch script?
#SBATCH --mem=48g
or even choose nodes with large memory:
#SBATCH --partition=largeMem
