SUMMARY:UnGagged London 2017
DESCRIPTION:UnGagged is an 'SEO tech conference meets Saturday night Live'. (Where the speakers are in charge!). For London 2016 we were proud to be the Headline Event of London Technology Week. \n\nUnGagged brings it's successful SEO/IM speaker-led format back to London. No dialing it down - no cleaning it up\, letting the best speakers on the SEO circuit speak about topics that other conferences won't.\n\n'This is the first REAL digital Unconvention. Where people can pull back the curtain and show you what they are actually doing. I'm excited to show a lot of stuff I've never been allowed to do before and say what I want to say'\n- Jeremy Schoemaker (AKA Shoemoney)\, UnGagged 2014 Las Vegas Keynote\n\nAfter the success of Las Vegas 2014\, 2015 and 2016 we're bringing the 'No BS SEO' theme back to London for the third time. Bringing together some of the most provocative\, fearless and business savvy thinkers on the planet\, who will finally be able to let off steam and share insights which they've been prevented from sharing at other\, more restrictive or corporate conventions.\n\n'I don't have to shut up this time. I have to bite my tongue at a lot of conferences\, I'm already know as being someone who is outspoken but this time I'm going to let it rip'\n- Scott Stratten\, President Un-Marketing\n\nConferences that take place in the UK are liable for UK VAT as they are classified under VAT legislation as ‘services supplied where performed’ and therefore VAT of the country hosting the conference must be charged. Overseas delegates must pay the VAT charged on their invoice initially but can potentially reclaim this back from the UK VAT office. For information on reclaiming VAT see HMRC Reference: Notice 723A (November 2010) 'Refunds of VAT in the European Community for EC and non-EC businesses' which can be obtained from www.hmrc.gov.uk
